# Backend redesign development

This is the working loop for [the redesign plan](backend-redesign-plan.md).
Phase 1 adds the new domain, SQLite store, host configuration and initial v4
contract described in [backend-domain.md](backend-domain.md). Runtime/SDK adoption
starts in Phase 2. The existing real-runtime SDK fixture remains an explicit
legacy reference until that slice replaces it.

## Start working

Use Go from `go.mod`, Node 24, and Task 3.48.0. From this checkout:

```sh
npm ci --no-audit --no-fund
task check:fast
task check:change
```

The integration branch is `codex/backend-redesign`. Open implementation PRs
against that branch, or stack a phase PR on its pending predecessor. The redesign
workflow also runs for PRs into phase branches. Keep each PR focused on a behavior
or invariant. Current
production gates on `main` and `development` remain unchanged.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `task check:fast` | Active Go package formatting and all their tests; no npm install needed |
| `task check:change` | Fast gate, active builds/vet/race tests, generated contracts, SDK/examples, real-runtime fixture |
| `task check:phase` | Change gate plus selected admission/recovery/accounting integration regressions |
| `task check:analysis` | New lint findings since the frozen baseline, plus reachable vulnerability checks on the active packages |
| `task check:fixture` | Rebuild SDK and run the isolated process-restart scenario |
| `task dev:redesign -- --minutes=10` | Start a disposable scripted-provider daemon for manual SDK/app work |

The optional repository pre-commit hook uses `check:fast` on the integration
branch and `codex/backend-redesign-*` branches. Other branches retain the current
hook. `task hooks` installs the repository hook if desired; this is a local Git
configuration choice, not a prerequisite for CI.

## Active scope

`REDESIGN_PACKAGES` in [Taskfile.yaml](../Taskfile.yaml) is the single Go package
list for fast, build, vet, race and analysis checks:

- `internal/content`: retained immutable content and access primitives.
- `internal/session`: pure durable values, pinned definitions and configuration resolution.
- `internal/store`: fresh schema, uniform root/child records and atomic transitions.
- `internal/config`: explicit fresh host files and credential references.
- `internal/protocol`: independent v4 DTOs, schemas and interchange fixtures.
- `cmd/whip-contract`: deterministic v4 generation and fixture validation.

All tests in these packages are active. Add new domain/store/runtime packages as
they land. Remove old packages only when their retained guarantees have been
replaced or their retirement is recorded. `go test -run` cannot hide test files
that fail to compile.

The phase gate separately names four existing daemon regressions: admission
before provider construction, queued child input across restart, settlement
failure without provider replay, and accounting-lock ordering. They are temporary
reference checks, not a requirement to preserve actors or child-specific APIs.

Both TypeScript contract packages, the retained SDK and SDK examples are active.
The fixture test
uses both Unix sockets and WebSocket. Full web/desktop/mobile/TUI/ACP suites
remain milestone obligations in phases 5–6. A shared contract change must expand
checks to every client already ported to that contract.

## Disposable fixture

The existing SDK fixture starts a real daemon and SQLite database in a temporary
home. `WHIP_SDK_AGENTS_FIXTURE=1` selects its actual agent loop and Starlark runtime
behind a scripted local HTTP provider. It needs no provider credentials and never
attaches to the installed daemon.

`dev:redesign` reuses the existing manual fixture launcher. It prints the isolated
host URL and working directory, stops on SIGINT/SIGTERM, and has a bounded
lifetime of 1–30 minutes. The fixture's frontend directory starts empty. For app
work, run `WHIP_WEB_DAEMON=<printed server URL> npm run dev:web` in another terminal;
do not point the development app at the normal installed daemon for this work.

Ordinary text receives `ack: <text>`. A prompt with a fenced `cell` block executes
that Starlark cell; a fenced `final` block selects the scripted final answer.
Permission and external-effect rules still apply. This is test input, not a
production provider API. The existing fixture's `/control/release` controls its
fake-runner mode; it is not a provider barrier in real-runtime mode.

The [acceptance scenario](../scripts/redesign/fixture.test.mjs) verifies:

1. Fresh isolated storage and protocol attachment over both transports.
2. Accepted input completes after the submitting client detaches.
3. Reusing a command identity returns the same admission and transcript.
4. The provider accounting proves the actual model loop ran once.
5. SIGKILL/restart preserves runtime identity, outcome, history and deduplication.
6. Successful shutdown removes the temporary fixture.

Failures retain database/WAL, bridge metadata, observations and daemon output
under `test-results/redesign/`, with the original temporary path printed too.
CI uploads that directory on failure. Fixture-startup failures also retain their
original temporary directory through the existing SDK helper.

This initial scenario does not establish lost-acknowledgement injection, queued
input crash behavior through the new SDK, mid-effect recovery or new-schema
semantics. Those remain explicit phase 2–3 acceptance obligations.

## CI

[backend-redesign.yml](../.github/workflows/backend-redesign.yml) runs on PRs into
the integration branch and pushes to it. Linux and macOS run the phase gate with
a race-instrumented fixture; a separate job runs pinned lint/vulnerability tools.
Their Go compiler caches have separate keys from each other and production CI,
so the first successful run can save the tools and race builds it actually uses.
The `redesign` aggregate requires every job to succeed, including after failure
or cancellation. It has no percentage-coverage gate. The existing production CI
and coverage floor remain intact.

Lint uses the repository's existing configuration and reports findings on code
changed since a frozen baseline revision. That baseline does not advance as
phases land. Five inherited findings are recorded below rather than suppressed
in source.
Those files now live in internal/legacy/session, outside the new active core.
Vulnerability checks have no baseline exclusion. Newly added packages have no
baseline code to exclude.

The active [integration-branch ruleset](https://github.com/context-labs/whip/rules/24090266)
requires the `redesign` context from GitHub Actions, with an up-to-date base. Its
only target is `refs/heads/codex/backend-redesign`. This is a repository setting
separate from the workflow file; its effective branch rules were read back after
creation. Remote failure/success evidence is recorded below.

## Baseline and phase 0 evidence

Baseline: `e3fed9c91918d9c36766dd47d878c1b5466238d1`, captured 2026-09-27
on macOS arm64 with Go 1.27.0, Node 24.14.1 and Task 3.48.0.

| Baseline check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `go build ./...` | Passed, 7.90 seconds |
| `go test -count=1 -timeout=10m ./internal/session ./internal/agent ./internal/agentdef ./internal/protocol ./internal/llm ./internal/rlm ./internal/daemon` | Six package suites passed; daemon failed; 68.68 seconds total |
| `npm ci --no-audit --no-fund` | Passed; lockfile unchanged |
| `npm run check` | Passed; protocol drift/interoperability, 466 SDK tests, client example build |

The baseline daemon failure is
`TestResumeActiveIsolatesFailuresAndAllowsRetry`, at `daemon_test.go:66`:
`failed restore changed saved session: <nil>`. It occurred before production
source changes. Its restore/configuration guarantee is assigned to phase 3;
this phase does not mark the full daemon suite green or change that assertion.
No full browser, mobile, desktop, TUI, signing or release validation was performed
for this baseline.

The initial full active-package lint run found three `nilnil` findings in
`internal/session/title.go` (lines 69, 77, 86) and two `perfsprint` findings in
`internal/session/title_admission_test.go` (lines 254, 284). These belong to the
phase 1 storage/title replacement or retirement. Phase 0 changes no production
Go code and does not change their semantics merely to clear the lint baseline.

| Phase 0 check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `task check:fast` | Passed; approximately 10 seconds initially, 0.52 seconds through the hook with warm test caches |
| `task check:phase` (includes `check:change`) | Passed; 170.04 seconds, including race checks, SDK/examples and real-runtime crash/restart |
| `WHIP_SDK_RACE=1 task check:fixture` | Passed; 10.68 seconds, including SDK build and the race-instrumented daemon |
| `task check:analysis` | Passed; 4.46 seconds with warm tool caches, no new lint findings or reachable vulnerabilities |
| Deliberate failing test in `internal/content` | `check:fast` failed with the expected marker in 0.71 seconds; test removed and branch hook passed |
| Manual fixture launcher, `--minutes=1` | Started, created SQLite, exited successfully on SIGTERM and removed its temporary directory; 1.67 seconds |
| Initial fixture assertion failure | Retained database, observations and daemon output; correcting the accounting check (unknown cost is independent of reported/estimated usage) produced a passing scenario |
| Workflow and patch validation | `actionlint` and `git diff --check` passed |

Logs and timings are under the ignored local `test-results/redesign/` directory.
The existing daemon restore failure remains outside the initial active gate and
is tracked above. These measurements do not include cold dependency downloads.
Required-check enforcement, failure propagation and the restored hosted phase
run are verified below.

The [remote canary run](https://github.com/context-labs/whip/actions/runs/36364503714)
deliberately introduced `TestRedesignGateCanary`. The test failed in both OS jobs,
analysis passed, and the required `redesign` aggregate failed. `gh pr checks 197
--required` reported that failed context. The temporary test was then removed.

The [first restored run](https://github.com/context-labs/whip/actions/runs/36364784940)
exposed a too-small timeout: the complete storage race suite exceeded three
minutes on both hosted OS runners, while advancing through different tests in
SQLite. It had passed locally in 135 seconds. The race step now allows ten
minutes per package, still under the job's twenty-minute limit. No tests or race
instrumentation were dropped; the fast gate is unchanged. Hosted timing must be
measured separately from the local warm measurements above.

The [restored hosted run](https://github.com/context-labs/whip/actions/runs/36365373490)
passed on revision `faecb7913994360f4254a924fb41a1249ff179b2`: Linux, macOS,
analysis and the required `redesign` aggregate all succeeded. The phase command
took 424 seconds on Linux and 359 seconds on macOS. Including setup and cache
upload, the jobs took 538 and 554 seconds respectively; analysis took 189 seconds.
These are first-run measurements for the separate cache keys, not claimed warm
CI timings. The hosted gate includes the race-instrumented SDK fixture.

Phase 0 is complete in [PR #197](https://github.com/context-labs/whip/pull/197).
No replacement runtime or schema was implemented by Phase 0.

## Phase 1 behavior ownership and evidence

The old session/config/protocol packages and v3 TypeScript contract were moved
to explicit legacy locations without aliases. The retained runtime and clients
still build against them. New core import tests prohibit reaching that runtime,
its managers, or legacy packages.

| Former active area | Phase 1 replacement or later obligation |
| --- | --- |
| Root and child storage, input acceptance, transcript commits | New store constraint, rollback, retry, root/child history and restart tests |
| Agent definition defaults and validation | New session canonical revisions, local schema validation, deep ownership and clear/inherit tests |
| v3 schema generator | New v4 generator and Go/TypeScript interchange; v3 checks remain for unported clients |
| Actor restore/title generation | Old actor behavior is retired; title metadata is revisioned here, model helper accounting and restore behavior belong to Phase 3 |
| Legacy child budgets, mail, grants and shared state | Phase 4 acceptance; no claim that Phase 1 replaces those guarantees |
| Checkpoints, process/workspace resources and broader client behavior | Phases 3–6; retained fixture and selected daemon regressions still run |

The new SQLite tests use disposable files and independent connections. They
inject failed receipt, transcript, configuration and deletion writes, check
rollback, then retry successfully. They cover foreign-schema rejection without
modification, concurrent initialization, topology/active-turn constraints,
configuration capture, bounded pages, stop/cancel/recovery and deletion receipts.
Host tests cover atomic concurrent initialization, strict files, environment
references and default changes that leave stored sessions intact. Contract
fixtures exercise actual Go JSON and TypeScript re-encoding with counters above
2^53, explicit clearing and invalid payloads; standalone validators run under
Node's prohibition on dynamic code generation.

Local validation on macOS arm64, Go 1.27.0 and Node 24.14.1:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Whole retained/new backend build | go build ./... passed |
| Warm fast gate | Passed, 0.30 seconds |
| Full phase gate | Passed, 35.58 seconds; active race/shuffle tests, both contracts, 466 SDK tests, examples, real-runtime restart fixture and four named daemon regressions |
| Analysis | No lint findings or reachable vulnerabilities in the active scope |
| Concurrent fresh initialization | 100 repeated runs under the race detector passed |
| Generated v4 contract | TypeScript compilation, three CSP-safe interop tests, Go fixture validation and deterministic drift passed |
| Patch/workflow validation | git diff --check and actionlint passed |

The first complete run found intermittent SQLITE_BUSY during concurrent
initialization. WAL setup now retries only its idempotent PRAGMA within a bounded,
context-cancellable wait. A held-reader test proves timeout and later success;
admission/claim/finish transactions are never automatically replayed.

| Phase 1 acceptance | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Fresh identity/config, no legacy readers | TestFreshIdentityAndForeignSchema, TestConcurrentInitialization, TestExplicitFreshHostAndAtomicInitialization, TestCoreImportBoundaries |
| Root uniqueness, same-tree parents, no cycles, one active turn | TestTopologyAndRevisionConstraints, TestIndependentConnectionsSerializeClaimsAndDuplicateAdmission |
| Uniform root/child persistence and history | TestConfigurationCaptureAndUniformHistory |
| Pinned definitions and independent values | TestDefinitionRevisionAndResolutionIsolation, TestDefinitionCanonicalSchemaOrdering, TestDefinitionAndHostEditsDoNotChangeRetainedSessions |
| Single authorities and captured configuration, no stored credentials | schema.sql, TestConfigurationCaptureAndUniformHistory, TestCredentialsRemainHostReferences, backend-domain.md ownership table |
| Atomic admission/claims and rollback, database-only construction | TestAtomicAdmissionClaimFinishAndRetry, TestTreeConfigurationAndDeletionRollback, TestCoreImportBoundaries |
| Retry/interruption/cancellation/deletion semantics | TestStopCancelRecoveryAndDeletion, TestClosedStoreRecoveryRetainsQueuedWork and backend-domain.md transitions |

The new persistence contract is ready for the Phase 2 runner/RPC/SDK slice.
No claim is made that the existing SDK or applications already use this store.
Hosted validation for the Phase 1 review is recorded after its workflow completes.
